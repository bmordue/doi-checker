# ADR-001: Input Validation and Security

## Status
Accepted

## Context

The DOI Checker application previously had minimal input validation and no security measures for API endpoints. This created several risks:

1. **Security vulnerabilities**: No rate limiting, missing input sanitization, lack of security headers
2. **Data integrity issues**: Insufficient validation of DOI inputs could lead to corrupted data
3. **Abuse potential**: No protection against malicious requests or DOS attacks
4. **User experience**: Poor error messages for invalid inputs

The application needed comprehensive input validation and security measures to ensure robust operation in a production environment.

## Decision

We will implement a comprehensive input validation and security layer consisting of:

### Input Validation (`src/lib/validation.js`)
- **Comprehensive request validation**: Validate structure, types, and constraints of all API inputs
- **DOI-specific validation**: Enforce DOI format requirements, length limits, and sanitization
- **Request safety checks**: Validate content-type, content-length, and user-agent headers
- **Input sanitization**: Remove potentially harmful control characters and enforce length limits

### Security Measures
- **Rate limiting**: Simple in-memory rate limiter (100 requests per minute per IP)
- **Security headers**: Implement standard HTTP security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
- **Request size limits**: Enforce maximum request body size (10KB)
- **Content-type validation**: Require proper JSON content-type for POST requests

### Error Handling Enhancement
- **Enhanced error responses**: Include security headers in all error responses
- **Contextual error messages**: Provide specific validation error messages
- **Test environment support**: Allow bypassing some security checks in test environments

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Improved security posture**: Protection against common web vulnerabilities and abuse
- **Better data integrity**: Ensures only valid DOIs are processed and stored
- **Enhanced user experience**: Clear error messages help users understand issues
- **Production readiness**: Application can safely handle production traffic
- **Maintainability**: Centralized validation logic is easier to maintain and extend

### Negative
- **Added complexity**: Additional validation layer increases code complexity
- **Performance overhead**: Validation checks add minimal processing time to requests
- **Test maintenance**: Tests need to accommodate new validation requirements
- **Backward compatibility**: Some edge cases may now be rejected that were previously accepted

### Neutral
- **Code size increase**: Additional ~200 lines of code for validation module and tests
- **Dependencies**: No additional external dependencies introduced

## Implementation Notes

- Rate limiting uses simple in-memory storage; should be replaced with Redis for multi-instance deployments
- User-agent validation can be bypassed in test environments using `x-test-request: true` header
- Validation is applied before any business logic, ensuring consistent security posture
- All validation errors return appropriate HTTP status codes (400, 429) with descriptive messages
